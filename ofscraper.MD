[bold red]OF-Scraper Announcements:1. For those who use cdrm for cdm; a fix has been pushed to handle errors from the CDRM-Project API. Previously FFMPEG would endlessly fail for effected downloads because of bad inputs being cached. Update to at least [bold yellow]3.12.7[/bold yellow]
2. cdrm seems to be getting ip blocked by onlyfans based on error messages, the fix is to use your own keys or switch to keydb
or to wait for the requests to work again
